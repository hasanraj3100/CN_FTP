Circuit Switching

has three phases; connection establishment, data transfer, connection released;
data unit knows the entire path address provided by the source
data is processed in the source system only
its not a store and forward technique
resource reservation is the feature because path is fixed for data transmission
more wastage of resources;

Packet Switching
directly data transfer takes place
data unit knows the destination address, intermediate path is decided by the routers.
data is processed in all intermediate nodes including source node
it is a store and forward technique
no resource reservation because the bandwidth is shared among the users.
less wastage of resources
=====================================

Internet Layer

Application, Transport, Network, DataLink, Physical

Application: Interact with the end users, provides network services to the user.
Transport Layer: Responsible for end to end communication between two nodes. Port addressing, segmentation;
Network Layer: Responsible for delivery of the packets, logical addressing and routing
data link: Transmits frames from one to another, creates data frames.
physical layer: responsible for transmitting individual bits

=================
Socket : one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the network. interface between application layer and transport layer. process sends and receives message from the network interface called socket.

app layer protocols
dns: resolve internet names to ip addresses
telnet: terminal emulation protocol provide remote access to servers and networking devices
dhcp: assign ip, mask, default gateaway, dns server
ftp: file transfer protocol
smtp: transfer male

ssl: provides encrypted tcp connections, data integrity and end point authentication
